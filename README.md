# HandFriendly
A collection of scripts/tools to remap the keyboard, starting with this remapping:

Capslock + IJKL == arrow keys (and more)

## Windows: 
Need to install Autohotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com/), and then run HandFriendly.ahk (

Alternatively, you could also compile the .ahk script into .exe using Authotkey, then just run the .exe without the need for AutoHotKey software.

## Mac OS:
Need to install Karabiner Elements (https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) and load the json file for the remappings.
Optionally, install Hammerspoon (https://www.hammerspoon.org/) and load the init.lua script for application switching shortcuts.
