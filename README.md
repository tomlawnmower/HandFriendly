# HandFriendly
A collection of scripts/tools to remap the keyboard, starting with this remapping:

Capslock + IJKL == arrow keys (and more)

## Windows: 
Need to install Autohotkey, and then run HandFriendly.ahk (Could also be compiled into .exe using Authotkey, then just run the .exe)

## Mac OS:
Need to install Karabiner Elements and load the json file for the remappings.
Optionally, install Hammerspoon and load the init.lua script for application switching shortcuts.
